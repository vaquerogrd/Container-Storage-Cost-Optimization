# Container Storage Cost Optimization

Building AI course project

## Summary

This project focuses on predicting storage costs for containers in logistics yards using machine learning techniques. It helps logistics companies optimize cost planning, enhance yard efficiency, and improve customer satisfaction. Developed as part of the Building AI course project.

## Background

Storage costs in container yards are influenced by unpredictable durations, inefficient space utilization, and unclear cost structures. Logistics companies like Medlog Austria face significant challenges in managing these costs, resulting in:
* Increased operational expenses.
* Limited transparency for clients.
* Suboptimal resource allocation.

This project aims to address these issues by leveraging AI to predict costs accurately and recommend storage optimizations, providing financial and operational benefits to logistics companies.

## How is it used?

The solution is integrated into the existing yard management systems. It takes in key inputs such as:
* Arrival and departure dates.
* Container size and type.
* Yard utilization metrics.

The AI model outputs:
* Predicted storage costs for each container.
* Recommendations to optimize space allocation.

For example, a yard manager can use the predictions to plan container movements and estimate costs during peak operational periods.

## Data sources and AI methods

### Data Sources:
* Historical container movement logs.
* Yard space utilization metrics.
* Costing data (e.g., daily rates, penalties).

### AI Methods:
* **Regression Analysis**: To predict storage durations and costs.
* **Clustering**: To identify storage patterns and optimize yard usage.
* **Visualization Tools**: To present predictions in a user-friendly manner.

| AI Technique        | Purpose                                |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Regression Analysis | Predicting durations and costs         |
| Clustering          | Identifying container movement trends  |
| Data Visualization  | Presenting actionable insights         |

## Challenges

While this project predicts storage costs effectively, it has certain limitations:
* It may not account for real-time disruptions (e.g., congestion, delays).
* It relies heavily on historical data, which may not always represent future scenarios accurately.
* Ethical considerations include ensuring fair cost predictions and avoiding bias in AI models.

## What next?

Future enhancements for the project include:
1. Real-time data integration for dynamic cost updates.
2. Expansion to optimize costs across multiple ports and yard systems.
3. Automating container allocation strategies to minimize storage costs further.

Collaboration with data scientists, access to larger datasets, and domain-specific expertise will be critical for further development.
