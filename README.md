# Container Storage Cost Optimization

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

This project aims to predict storage costs for containers in logistics yards by leveraging machine learning techniques. The solution helps logistics companies optimize storage planning, reduce costs, and enhance customer satisfaction by providing actionable insights.

## Background

Storage costs in container yards are affected by unpredictable storage durations and operational inefficiencies. Logistics companies, like Medlog Austria, face significant challenges in managing these costs, leading to increased operational expenses and suboptimal resource utilization. 

This project addresses:
* Unpredictable container storage durations.
* Inefficiencies in yard space utilization.
* Lack of transparency in cost structures.

This project is important as it provides both financial and operational benefits to logistics companies and their clients, ensuring smoother operations and better cost management.

## How is it used?

The solution integrates into the existing container yard management system. Users (yard managers and logistics planners) input container-related data, such as:
* Arrival and departure dates
* Container size and type
* Yard space allocation

The AI model predicts storage costs and generates reports that include:
* Cost breakdowns
* Recommendations for optimizing storage

This tool is used in:
* Container yards for cost estimation.
* Customer invoicing processes for increased transparency.

## Data sources and AI methods

### Data Sources:
* Historical container movement logs (arrival and departure data).
* Yard layout and space utilization metrics.
* Storage cost parameters and rates.

### AI Methods:
* **Regression Analysis**: Predicting storage durations and costs.
* **Clustering**: Grouping containers based on movement patterns.
* **Visualization**: Displaying cost trends and decision-making insights.

| AI Technique        | Purpose                                |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Regression Analysis | Predicting durations and costs         |
| Clustering          | Identifying container movement trends  |
| Data Visualization  | Presenting insights to end-users       |

## Challenges

The project does not solve:
* Real-time disruptions (e.g., sudden operational delays).
* Ad-hoc container movements that deviate from typical patterns.
* Ethical considerations include ensuring fair cost calculations and avoiding biases in the model.

## What next?

Future steps for the project:
1. Add real-time data integration for dynamic predictions.
2. Expand the model to include multi-port operations.
3. Explore cost-saving strategies like slot optimizations.

To move forward, collaboration with data scientists, domain experts, and access to richer datasets will be essential.
